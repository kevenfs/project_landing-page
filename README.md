# Landing Page Project

This project was made using the starter project provided. It had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project.

## Specifications

This project demanded that it went from a static project to an interactive one. It required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## JavaScript file

First, the dynamically built navbar was built by looping over the section ids and getting their information for the datanav for proper display.
Second, these elements were than moved into an unordered list.
Third, an active state was then added to the elements in the viewport through an event listener.
Finally, the viewport was set for the active state to be properly defined.


## CSS file

Not much was done here except changing the color scheme for the active state.

## HTML file

Very little was done here as well other than adding 4 more sections to the main content.
